Building requires the following packages to be installed on
your machine:
g++, makedepend, flex, bison and xerces-c-3.1.1

To build run the 'build.sh' script

Before you run the programs you must first edit the script
'setEnv.sh' so that the environment variables matches
the path to 'granska' on your local computer.
Then run the script whith the command '. setEnv.sh' (not the
