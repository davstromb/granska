Building requires the following packages to be installed on
your machine:
g++, makedepend, flex, bison and xerces-c-3.1.1

To build run 'make' and install the library with 'sudo make install'.

This will create two executables: scrutinizer and testlibrary;
and a dynamic library: 'granska'.
'scrutinizer' is the actual granska program and 'testlibrary' is
a small program that makes use of the library 'granska',
to see that it works. 
Testlibrary takes two arguments:
1: A textfile to be scrutinized.
2: A number which represents to number of times to scrutinize the text.

Before you run the programs you must run the script
'setEnv.sh'. It takes as argument the path to the
'granska' directory on your local computer.
Example:
. setEnv.sh argument 
(not the space after the dot).
