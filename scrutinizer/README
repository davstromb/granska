Building requires the following packages to be installed on
your machine:
g++, makedepend, flex, bison and xerces-c-3.1.1

To build run the 'build.sh' script

This will create two executables: scrutinizer and testlibrary;
and a dynamic library in 'libgranska.so'.
'scrutinizer' is the actual granska program and 'testlibrary' is
a small program that makes use of the library 'libgranska.so'
to see that it works.

Before you run the programs you must first edit the script
'setEnv.sh' so that the environment variables matches
the path to 'granska' on your local computer.
Then run the script whith the command '. setEnv.sh' (not the
space after the dot).
